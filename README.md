### Basketball
Basketball is my favourite team sport. It can be played by people of all ages. **We dont need anything except a hoop and a ball to practice it**. It can be played with 5 team members or as less as 1 to 2 people and still have the same fun. It's a **great pastime** for any one and is a great way to bond with family members and friends. It is a sport that can work your whole body. It is a fast-paced game with lots of **running and jumping**, hence we can burn calories.
